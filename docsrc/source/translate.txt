Translating
===========

In order to translate puddletag you need Git, Qt Linguist, the PyQt6 translation tools (specifically pylupdate6) and the ability to copy/paste into the console.

In Ubuntu and Debian-based distros, Git is available in 'git' package, Qt Linguist in linguist-qt6 and pylupdate6 in pyqt6-dev-tools.

After installing the required tools, you'll need to retrieve the latest development release. Open up a terminal and paste the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag.git

The dev version will downloaded into the puddletag directory. Change into the dev directory with:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd puddletag

Then run update_translation.py with your desired locale (eg en_ZA, rus, fr) like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    python update_translation.py your_locale

.. note::

    You can later update the dev version without downloading the whole thing again by using the following command in the downloaded puddletag dir:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git pull origin master

A translation file will be created in **puddlestuff/translations/puddletag_your_locale.ts**. Open this file in **Qt Linguist** and translate to your heart's content.

To test your translation, generate a .qm file using **File->Release** in Qt Linguist. puddletag_your_locale.qm will be generated in the directory the .ts file you opened is stored.

Copy the .qm to **~/.config/puddletag/translations** (you'll need to create the translations dir). Next time you start puddletag you'll have the option to switch to the language in **Edit->Preferences**.

Otherwise just run:

.. code-block:: bash

    puddletag --langfile /path/to/your_locale.qm

That being said, I recommend you run the dev version, because the strings used may differ from the latest release. To do so use:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/puddletag_dev_dir
    python ./puddletag

Where **path/to/puddletag_dev_dir** is the path of the directory you downloaded the dev version of puddletag to.

When you're done, create an issue on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag/issues>`_ with your translation (the .ts file) and I'll merge it in.
